    <p>Butter chicken is one of the most famous dishes associated with Indian restaurants and Indian culture in general, and for good reason. It traditionally uses tandoori chicken cooked in a tandoor (a type of Indian oven) that gives the chicken a wonderful smoky flavor.</p>
    <p>This is an easier recipe that has been extremely popular over the years. The sauce is perfect when creamy and not too thick or too thin. The level of salt and spices can be suited to your taste. Garam and tandoori masala can be found in the ethnic aisle of your grocery store.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tamdoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
